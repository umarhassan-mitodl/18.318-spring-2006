"Reasonable'' collaboration is permitted, but you should not just copy someone else's solution or look up a solution from an outside source. We will (subjectively) indicate the difficulty level of each problem as follows:

\[1\] easy  
\[2\] moderately difficult  
\[3\] difficult  
\[4\] horrendously difficult  
\[5\] unsolved

Further gradations are indicated by + and -; e.g., \[3-\] is a little easier than \[3\]. A rating of \[5-\] denotes an unsolved problem that has received little (if any) attention and may not be difficult.
